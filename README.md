 # dotfiles
 
 dotfiles and system setup for MacOS and Linux
 
 **Goal**
 
 Provide a reliable and complete development environment supporting both MacOS and Linux. The idea is that if I dropped my laptop in the bath one day, I can set up a new one just by pulling this repo and running the setup script.
 
 ** Todo **
 
 - [ ] Use NeoVim
